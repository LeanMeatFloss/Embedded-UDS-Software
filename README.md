# Easy-Integration-Embedded-UDS-Software
An implementation of UDS software for embedded chip.
The target of the project is that to design an UDS software that can be easily integrated to an existing programs.
To achieve the target, the software should have those features:
1. The software can be pack as an lib and header files before integration. Which means the software user only need to use or realize the functions and variables in the head files to realize the UDS in the program.
2. The software should be configurable.
3. The software can drive using the abstract interface which need software user to realize.
